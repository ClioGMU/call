  <h1>About the Project</h1>
  <p1>Ministers and pastors across denominations often understand their career as the direct result of something called a “call.” By this they are usually referring to a specific moment in which God intervened in their lives or career paths and made it abundantly clear that they were to work in and for the church from then on. However, how individuals have understood and reacted to this call not only varies from place to place but has changed over time. In short, the call itself is highly contextual. This site seeks to collect the stories of individuals who have received a call to ministry. The hope is for it to be a place not only for individuals to share their religious experiences and a place for historians and scholars to begin to grapple with how the Christian church understands and transfers its leadership from generation to generation.<br/><br/>The site was designed and is run by <a href="https://rrchnm.org/author/brandon-buck/">Brandon Buck</a> and <a href="https://rrchnm.org/author/kris-stinson/">Kristofer Stinson</a>.</p1>
